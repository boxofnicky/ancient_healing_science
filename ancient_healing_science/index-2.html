			<h1>Welcome to Reiki healing- World of Spiritual Healing</h1>
			<p>Before I get into the specifics, let me give you a brief account of my life's quest. I was intrigued by the stories of eastern mysticism like touch healing, angel healing, law of attaraction, crystal healing, past life regression, wish manifestation and sixth sense. If this phenomenon is really possible then why is this knowledge accessible to only a handful of sages or mystics. Skeptics can merely reject on account of absence of scientific explaination, while others can simply step aside and call it a God's gift or destiny. I started investing my time and money to find answers. So, today after years of research I can safely quote that we all can learn from this ancient wisdom.<br />

        <dt class="heading">Ankur Jain</dt><dd class="text">I have known Chandana didi from the past few months. I was lucky to meet her when i was going through the darkest phase of my life- Personally and professionally. The situation was so bad and upsetting that my emotional pain was transformed into physical pain. I wanted to change things but didn’t know how to do it, until I met Chandana didi. She introduced me to the concept of Angel Therapy and how we can change our life by thinking positive thoughts. She supported me and helped me feel safe and secure. She helped me to FORGET and FORGIVE everyone involved in the situation including myself. <br>
The most astonishing experience I had was when I went for the healing of Bulge on my lower spine. Unfortunately, I developed it at an young age of 25 and I tried every possible thing from medicines to physiotherapy but nothing seemed to work. She provided me  21-day Reiki session which involved crystal healing, chakra clearing, chord cutting, grounding, aura cleaning, affirmations and EFT. The results were instant, 90% of my spine pain has reduced and now I have got back to my daily routine. 
<br>
Chandana didi is an amazing human being, a true friend and a great healer. She brought me complete healing of mind, body and soul. I’ll always be thankful to god for sending an angel in the form of Chandana didi when I needed healing, hope and light, the most.

        <dt class="heading">Sapna Sharma</dt><dd class="text">Dear Chandana, It has been one journey with you ever since we have met. There are no denials that spiritual support is beyond all logics and if it comes through a well connected healer, it becomes easy to receive Divine Guidance and interpret your intuitions. Angel Card Reading has given lot of confidence, strength and support to take the right path. Not just this whenever I got my healing done by Chandana, I have felt noticeable change in me. Nothing changes overnight but small small steps towards BIG change makes vast difference. Thanks a lot Chandana. God Bless You, through you not just me but many more will benefit.
 </dd>
        <dt class="heading">Dr. Preeti Jain (JEWELSBYPREETI)</dt><dd class="text">Chandana was the one who explained  to me about the Angel Therapy and my life has changed since then for good. I also got my Past Life therapy done from her which was really good and healed me in a lot of ways. Its nice to have a person who not only understands your trouble but also goes out of her way to help to get over it. When you meet Chandana you get to know that her main aim is to heal people. Also I swear by her healing sessions, the result of which you get to see instantly. I would suggest everyone to go to Chandana for Reiki, Past Life Regression or for any other healing they are looking for as it is very important to go to the right person for the required therapy. </dd>
        <dt class="heading">Saurabh Suman</dt><dd class="text">It had been a world of indecisiveness and confusion all this while and the life was getting too much caught in this labyrinth and every effort to move this into the right track just seemed to be distant with time. Chandana has been a good friend and guide all through my trials and tribulations. This friend of mine not only influenced my mind with her positive thoughts but also through her Card readings has put my life into a definite direction with an extremely permanent influence on my mind which now finds decision making and drawing things closer to me which I desire.<br>
 Instances have been there where her strength invoking thoughts actually resurrected my confidence, mend my few broken relations, erase my doubtful mind with all negativity and attract positive outcomes through positive thoughts. In fact after her affirmations that she gave me I actually ended up with getting the best boss of my life who actually influenced my thoughts making myself a lot calmer and a better professional and person. This all happened because I attracted him into my life and like an angel he changed my life. <br>
I am right now going through her crystal-grid therapy which is already showing some visible changes in my professional life and a few successes in my job are already showing up too.<br> 
I would thank Chandana for her professional guidance and more for her calm and serene nature to help me out of all ill wills and directing my life towards what I desire in life.</dd>
        <dt class="heading">Vivek Kumar</dt><dd class="text">Its all a new approach now, a new thought process , a new way to lead the life , which tells us to be Positive and send positive messages to the universe to receive the highest good in return.  For this, our Guardian Angels and Archangels are always there to help us, its just we need to be aware of their existence in our life as messengers of God, who are always ready to help us, when we ask them for the Help... <br>
All thanks to you Chandana Di, for helping us, to understand the divine guidance. The Reiki treatment and the Healing sessions followed by the powerful Chanting sessions have all  helped me immensely in bringing positive changes to my life and ways to lead it ... Thanks to my Angels as well because of whom I was able to come to her ...
